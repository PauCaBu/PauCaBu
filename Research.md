Hello!, I know nothing, but partially this things:

# 1. Analysis of the formation of Massive Globular Cluster ≤safter a Galaxy Merge
#### January 2019 – February 2019
- The aims were to evaluate and characterize the stability of the Galaxy Merge to predict which regions would eventually form a Massive Globular Cluster.
- The data used for this research were Snapshots from the GADGET-2 sph simulator.

# 2. Classification of Galaxies above the Main Sequence using their Spectral Energy Distribution properties
#### March 2019 – July 2019
- The aim was to characterize the Spectral Energy Distribution modeling of the clumps, formed in the Main Sequence, to later predict them.
- For clustering analysis, Gaussian Mixture Method was utilized; while for characterization it was used Principal Component Analysis.

# 3. Search for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in Nearby Galaxies using Spectral Analysis
#### September 2019 – January 2020
- The aims were to find Intermediate-Mass Black Holes by fitting the Broad Components to Halpha emission lne.
- The data used were galaxies that showed fast Variability in the Optical from the High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) (Forster et al., 2016)

# 4. Testing the Efficacy of Searching Intermediate-Mass Black Holes through Optical Variability
#### April 2020 - December 2020
- We search for spectral Active galactic Nuclei signatures in a sample of active Intermediate-
Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) candidates selected by fast optical variability, which compose the
SIBLING survey (Martinez-Palomera et al. 2020). These signatures are the broad components
in the Balmer emission lines.
- The aims are to test the occurancy of AGN spectral signatures on the SIBLING survey in
comparison to a sample that does not present fast variability

# 5. Empiric constraints to the Seed models for Supermassive Black Holes
#### December 2020 – Now
- We thoroughly study a sample of viable IMBH candidates from the SIBLING survey, by
assuring their fast variability on the g-band, utilizing the LSST Science Pipeline software.
- The robust sample of IMBHs will be used to constrain the occupation fraction of estimated
BH mass as a function of the stellar mass of their galaxy host
